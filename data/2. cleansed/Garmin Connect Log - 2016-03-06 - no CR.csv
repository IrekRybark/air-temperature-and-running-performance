My bet is on an instance of goofing around during the last half marathon race when I sprang to a sprint after high-five-ing a sign ""Touch for extra energy!"".

Glorious morning.  Was able to see Manhattan from Washington Rock. Messed up the course so technically climbed Watchung nearly twice. I have a feeling that walking up hill would have been faster than running.  
Running along Rt.22 not nice... must avoid in the future.  
Around mile 11 my mind started playing tricks on me... but fixed it with more walk and fruit bar.  Interestingly, I weighted 3lb less after the run.  I guess water...

Friggin cold, 23F and windy.  It seems that my legs from the knees down did not really warm up regardless wearing two layers.  Either I need better insulated layers or the third one would help.
Besides that battery in my watch is going south (showed battery low this morning even disconnected from the charger only around 11pm yesterday), the cold affect the battery capacity.  So the watch shut down after the first mile... Well... how much sense does it make to run Magic Mile without a watch? LOL
